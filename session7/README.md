This Jupyter notebook covers advanced data manipulation using Pandas, including:

Topics
- Lambda Functions and Map
- Series Operations
- Data Manipulation (`value_counts`, `drop_duplicates`)
- Handling Missing Data

I did the Pandas II Advanced Data Manipulation exercises where we had to create a lambda function and map (Series) and (DataFrame) manipulations, and the Handling missing data exercises too
