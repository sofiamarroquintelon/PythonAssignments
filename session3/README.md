Assignment from session 3

This assignment implements an academic system using OOP. 

I created 3 main classes: Course, Student and Register which allows us to manage courses, enrolling students and assigning grades in order to calculate de GPA from each one. 
In this exercises I defined courses and students using course and student classes; then, I used the Register class to manage the students enrollments in courses and the grades. Lastly I executed methods such as gpa() to calculate a student's GPA and show_all_courses() to list the availabre courses.
